# Twitch-Streams

"[Twitch-Streams](https://alexgooz.github.io/Twitch-Streams/)" is a website that uses the *[Twitchtv JSON API](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/v5/reference/streams/#get-stream-by-user)* to see who is streaming at the moment. I made this for a freeCodeCamp challenge (Use the Twitchtv JSON API).

## Outline

The outline of the challenge was:
- The website will tell you if Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.
- The User can click on the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.
- If a Twitch user is currently streaming, The website will tell you additional details about what they are streaming. 
- The website will add a placeholder icon if a streamer has closed their Twitch account (or the account never existed).
